Do not reload the entire offcanvas with HTMX. Otherwise, STR :
1. Select a filter from the top bar (one with btn_dropdown_filter=True)
2. Quickly (before HTMX results are loaded), open the offcanvas by pressing « Tous les filtres »
Results load, offcanvas panel is oob-replaced by the response content, and initially not visible, leaving only
the viewable backdrop and no filter offcanvas.
