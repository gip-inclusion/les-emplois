    Do not reload the entire offcanvas with HTMX. Otherwise, STR :
    1. Select a filter from the top bar (one with btn_dropdown_filter=True)
    2. Quickly (before HTMX results are loaded), open the offcanvas by pressing « Tous les filtres »
    Results load, offcanvas panel is oob-replaced by the response content, and initially not visible, leaving only
    the viewable backdrop and no filter offcanvas.
