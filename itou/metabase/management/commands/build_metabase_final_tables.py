Command runned manually from time to time by C2 data analysts via a github action.

This commands only runs the quick final SQL requests otherwise completed at the end of
the daily `populate_metabase_itou` and the weekly `populate_metabase_fluxiae` commands.

This is convenient for our data analysts to quickly apply their latest merged PR changes without
having to complete a long `populate_metabase_itou` command which takes several hours.
