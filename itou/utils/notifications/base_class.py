class BaseNotification:
    """
    Base class used in the notifications system.
    - A **notification** represents any transactional email sent to recipients.
    - A **recipient** is, in the real world, an end user that can whether accept or refuse
    to receive a notification. In our code, a recipient represents the model used to store this preference.

    Notifications preferences are stored as a JSON dictionary like this one:
    ```
    {notification.name: {"subscribed": True}}
    ```

    Usage:
    - In the model saving recipients preferences, add a new `JSONField` `notifications`
    and generate a migration
    - Add a `notifications.py` in the app folder
    - In `notifications.py`, create a class for each notification and inherit from BaseNotification
    - Override the `__init__` method as well as `email` and `recipients_email` properties. Provide a Notification.NAME.

    Live example:
    - Model: itou/siaes/models.py > SiaeMembership
    - Notifications: itou/job_applications/notifications.py
