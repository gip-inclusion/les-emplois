name: 🌈 Populate metabase itou

# Runs "populate_metabase_itou".
# A github action takes care of the cron task that:
# - creates a machine on demand
# - runs the desired command via a worker
# - waits a reasonable amount of time for the script to complete
# - destroys the machine once the update is done
on:
  workflow_dispatch: # allows us to run this action manually
  schedule:
    # Run this workflow every night.
    # 19:00 here means 21:00 or 22:00 in France depending on winter/summer time.
    - cron: '0 19 * * *'

# How to run this:
# Locally:
# - download and install locally "act" (https://github.com/nektos/act)
# - create a file "act.secrets" with all the necessary secrets (see the env variables below)
# - "act --secret-file ./act.secrets -j populate_metabase_itou" will run the job populate_metabase_itou with the specified environment variables
# In production:
# - automatically, as a cron job configured above
# - with github cli (https://cli.github.com/manual/): gh workflow run populate-metabase-itou.yml
# - with github’s web UI: https://github.com/betagouv/itou/actions

    # Default github action workflow timeout is 6 hours (360 minutes). If the script lasts longer than this for any
    # reason, the github action will be killed but the clever instance will keep running forever as the last job
    # supposed to delete it was never runned. This is why we want a very large timer here because clever instances
    # are expensive but github actions are not.
    # Unfortunately this does not work as any new timeout value above 6 hours is silently ignored and github keeps
    # killing the job after the default 6 hours. This is due to the fact that there is also a maximum job execution
    # time limit of 6 hours for Github-hosted runners. Thus we cannot push through 6 hours unless we one day use
    # self-hoster runners. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
    # Another possible solution would be, as recommended by Clever support, to end the github action immediately
    # after launching the clever instance with its worker, and add a "harakiri" script at the end of
    # `CC_WORKER_COMMAND` to make the clever instance connect by itself to the clever API, and order its own deletion.
