name: 🌈 Populate metabase itou

# Runs "populate_metabase_itou".
# A github action takes care of the cron task that:
# - creates a machine on demand
# - runs the desired command via a worker
# - waits a reasonable amount of time for the script to complete
# - destroys the machine once the update is done
on:
  workflow_dispatch: # allows us to run this action manually
  schedule:
    - cron: '12 0 * * *' # Run this workflow at 0:12am every day

# How to run this:
# Locally:
# - download and install locally "act" (https://github.com/nektos/act)
# - create a file "act.secrets" with all the necessary secrets (see the env variables below)
# - "act --secret-file ./act.secrets -j populate_metabase" will run the job populate_metabase with the specified environment variables
# In production:
# - automatically, as a cron job configured above
# - with github cli (https://cli.github.com/manual/): gh workflow run populate-metabase.yml
# - with github’s web UI: https://github.com/betagouv/itou/actions

    # Default github action workflow timeout is 6 hours (360 minutes). If the script lasts longer than this for any reason,
    # the github action will be killed but the clever instance will keep running forever as the last job supposed to
    # delete it was never runned. This is why we set a very large timer here (24 hours == 1440 minutes) because
    # clever instances are expensive but github actions are not. Cutting financial costs is the reponsibility of the
    # last job, not of github.
    # Unfortunately this does not work, the new timeout value is silently ignored and github keeps killing the job
    # after the default 6 hours. This will need to be investigated further.
